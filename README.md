#Background
After 2 weeks of self-teaching HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I decided to create my own version of the game minesweeper to practice these languages. This game is published to the web and can be played here:
http://myhumble-acode.com/MINESWEEPER/myminesweeper.html

This repository contains the CSS, HTML, and Javascript files that are used in my implementation of the game.
